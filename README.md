Shoots is a simple screenshot capturing script.

NOTE: This script uses libraries, be sure to install them. Documentaries are below:

Tkinter, 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html

PIL (to import ImageGrab)
https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

datetime (to import Screenshot date and time)
https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html

I've also made an EXE executable using PyInstaller.
