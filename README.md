# shoots
Shoots is a simple screenshot capturing script.

NOTE: This script uses libraries, be sure to install them. Documentaries are below:

Tkinter 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html

PIL (to import ImageGrab)
https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

datetime (to import Screenshot date and time)
https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html

I've also made an EXE executable using PyInstaller. (Only works for release 1.0.0)

# UPDATED 2.0.0

This version has new features such as:

路 Shutter sound when screen is captured
路 Added an option menu to choose waited seconds
路 Added a notification badge to notify about the capture
路 Added script a sleek icon.

Removed EXE executable as it is incompatible with new libraries.
